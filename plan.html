<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The Slammers web site is intended to increase number of players to join their competition by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat players.
  </p>
  
 <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
	<p>Other advertising will be consistent for a period until the next competition, so that any increase in players should be attributable to the site. The number of new players will be counted and compared to the previous competition.
	</p>
	
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p>Families, mostly between the ages of 35 and 50 form the majority of our current audience, and this is who the site is aimed at and also those between the ages of 15 and 30 while they are in high schools, getting them to know about Slammers more.
